# traffic-simulation

### Code Structure 
- `TrafficLight`
    - `TrafficLight` is a child class of `TrafficObject`.
    - `void waitForGreen()` and `void simulate()` as well as `TrafficLightPhase getCurrentPhase()`, where `TrafficLightPhase` is an enum that can be either red or green.  
    - a private method `void cycleThroughPhases()` and a private member `_currentPhase` which can take red or green as its value.
    - cycleThroughPhases() method: 
        - measures the time between two loop cycles 
        - toggles the current phase of the traffic light between red and green
        - The cycle duration should be a random value between 4 and 6 seconds, 
        - while-loop uses `std::this_thread::sleep_for` to wait 1ms between two cycles
        - it is started in a thread when the public method simulate is called from a thread queue
- `MessageQueue`
    - A MessageQueue class is defined in the header of class TrafficLight which has the public methods send and receive.
    - `send` should take an rvalue reference of type `TrafficLightPhase` whereas `receive` should return this type. 
    - defines a `std::dequeue` called `_queue`, which stores objects of type TrafficLightPhase. 
    - variable `std::condition_variable` , an `std::mutex` as private members.
- `send` 
    - use the mechanisms `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` and `_condition.notify_one()` to add a new message to the queue
    - send a notification.
    - In the class `TrafficLight`, a private member of type `MessageQueue` is created and used within the infinite loop to push each new `TrafficLightPhase` into it by calling `send` in conjunction with move semantics. 
- `receive`
    - use `std::unique_lock<std::mutex>` and `_condition.wait()` to wait for and receive new messages  
    - pull messages from the queue using move semantics
    - The received object is returned by the `receive` function
- `waitForGreen()`
    - The method `waitForGreen` is completed, in which an infinite while loop runs 
    - repeatedly calls the `receive` function on the message queue. 
    - Once it receives `TrafficLightPhase::green`, the method returns.
- message exchange
    - a private member `_trafficLight` of type `TrafficLight` 
    - The method `Intersection::simulate()` starts the simulation of `_trafficLight`
    - The method `Intersection::addVehicleToQueue` use the methods `TrafficLight::getCurrentPhase` and` TrafficLight::waitForGreen` to block the execution until the traffic light turns green.
